# FDM-localization

Kindly help us improve Free Download Manager :)


This repository contains .po files for [FDM 5.x](http://www.freedownloadmanager.org/download.htm) localization. To edit files, you will need the [Poedit](https://poedit.net/download) program.


There are two ways to download the .po file for your language from GitHub.

1. Choose the file → click it → right click the Raw button <http://screencast.com/t/Ziirr24s> → right click to save as…

The wanted file should be launched in the Poedit program. If it failed, try way 2.

2. Press the ‘Clone or download’ button → Download ZIP (<http://screencast.com/t/XAPfA701o>)


Some tips

- Check translated words (if there are any).
- Don’t translate words in brackets.
- Please keep the punctuation and capital/small letters the same as in the English version.
- Translate words in the corresponding field <http://screencast.com/t/J0iHF4CE>
