# FDM-localization

This repository contains .po files for [FDM 5.x](http://www.freedownloadmanager.org/download.htm) localization

To edit files, you will need the [Poedit](https://poedit.net/download) program (recommended for ordinary users) or code editor software (not recommended but as a choice for high-level users).


If you use code editor software:

1. Be aware that the files support UTF-8 characters and lines are ended in LF (Unix Format)!

2. Localized strings should be filled only in MSGSTR"", don't change other parts of the file.

Many thanks for your help! It's highly appreciated.
